This README will be remove.

In order to upload the code on aulaweb, we have removed code/bin and code/enhsp, so to execute it, you need to load the two folders.

The implementation runs in all domains (and return a sequence of actions for each problem).
For the fifth problem of third domain (hanoi - prob05) the computation time was to high to perform the test, until its conclusion, so we cannot conclude in this case.
